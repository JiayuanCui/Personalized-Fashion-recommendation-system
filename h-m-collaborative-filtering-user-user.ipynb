The core idea behind it is as follow: \n","* For a given user (`u`), we will search for similar users. Let's say, the 10 most similar users to `u`. This is `u`'s neighborhood. \n","* We search for the most popular items in this neighborhood of users similar to `u`, `I`\n","* We check the items that are popular in the group of users similar to `u`, that `u` hasn't purchased yet.\n","* We recommend those items to `u`\n","\n","Now, we need to operationalize two things here: \n","* What does it mean that 2 users are similar?\n","* What does it mean that an item is popular in a group of users?\n","\n","For the similarity among users, we will just compare their purchases. The overlap of their purchased items is the similarity of the users. With this idea, we want to capture users with similar consumption patterns.\n","\n","For the popularity of items in a group, there are more simple and more complex definitions. We can just take the number of purchases a given product has in a group and rank all the possible products with that metric. Or we can consider the similarity to the original user `u` and weight the purchases depending on who was purchasing. That way, purchases of users that are more similar to `u` will have a stronger impact on the overall ranking of products.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**In version 20 I have removed Heng's \"time is our best friend\" model as the fallback model for cold start and put a simple 12-most popular one in its place. Heng's baseline seems to be performing much better than my UUCF so the reporting a `0.019` score is actually a `-0.001` against doing nothing. I want to see the result of the UUCF by itself. I was expecting to outperform the baseline with a subset of users under the UUCF regime, but I couldn't till now. The next steps in order to make UUCF work would be to have a validation strategy and extract the hyperparameters of the code in order to find the optimal combination. Hope someone can make the UUCF perform better (I know it can).**\n","\n","If I can obtain a score that surpasses the `0.02`, using UUCF + Heng's baseline, I will share it for sure.\n","\n","\n","\n","# Please, _DO_ upvote if you find this kernel useful or
